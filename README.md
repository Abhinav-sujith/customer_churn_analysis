# customer_churn_analysis

# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and understand the churn behavior of customers for a telecom company using SQL. The analysis focuses on identifying the factors that contribute to customer attrition, and the insights derived can help the company make data-driven decisions to improve customer retention.

# Introduction

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over a given period, which is an important metric for any subscription-based business. In the telecom industry, retaining customers is critical due to high competition and the cost of acquiring new customers. By analyzing the factors that lead to churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain their valuable customers.

This project leverages SQL queries to perform in-depth analysis on a customer dataset, with a focus on calculating churn rates, investigating churn reasons, and evaluating the impact of customer attributes (such as age, gender, and service types) on churn.

# Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

Analyze customer churn data to identify patterns and trends.
Calculate churn rates across different customer segments (e.g., age range, gender, tenure, service types).
Investigate the impact of different factors such as monthly charges, customer status, and service offers on churn.
Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to measure the revenue generated from churned and retained customers.

# Goal

The goal of this project is to provide insights that can help the company:

Understand the main drivers of churn.
Identify high-risk customer segments that may require targeted retention strategies.
Evaluate the effectiveness of various offers, services, and customer demographics in preventing churn.
Improve overall customer retention by using data-driven insights.

# Conclusion

By performing this customer churn analysis, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of why customers leave and how they can take preventive actions. The findings from this analysis can help optimize marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and ultimately reduce churn rates.

The insights gained from customer demographics, service usage, and churn categories will aid in developing personalized customer retention strategies. The use of SQL queries makes the analysis flexible and scalable, allowing the company to continuously monitor and adjust retention strategies as needed.
